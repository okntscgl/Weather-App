# Weather-App

This is a simple Weather Application built using Python, PyQt5, and the OpenWeatherMap API. The app allows users to enter a city name and get real-time weather data, including the temperature, weather description, and an appropriate weather emoji representing the current conditions.

Features
City-based Weather Search: Enter a city name to fetch the current weather.
Temperature in Fahrenheit: Displays the temperature in Fahrenheit (based on OpenWeatherMap's data).
Weather Emojis: Weather conditions are represented with emojis (e.g., ðŸŒ§ for rain, â˜€ for sunny weather).
Error Handling: The app gracefully handles errors, such as invalid city names or issues with the API request.
